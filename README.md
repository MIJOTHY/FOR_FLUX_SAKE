# ![flux logo](/assets/img/flux_logo_fandc.png) FOR_FLUX_SAKE ![flux logo](/assets/img/flux_logo_fandc.png)
A simple tutorial for simple people who want to use flux with react.
This tutorial builds on [my react tutorial](https://github.com/MIJOTHY/REACT_SCHMEACT)

## Pre-requisites
Although this guide attempts to be as beginner-friendly as possible, it does make some assumptions about your background. It assumes:
 * Familiarity with Javascript (you understand what the map function does),
 * Understanding of the module.exports / require pattern,
 * Some experience with React (you understand the difference between state and props).
