A simple tutorial for simple people who want to use flux with react.
This tutorial follows on from [my react tutorial (WIP)](https://github.com/MIJOTHY/REACT_SCHMEACT).

In this tutorial, we'll be converting a purely react app into one that incorporates the flux pattern. By doing so, I hope you can see why you  probably want to use flux if you're using react, and how you can go about changing your app accordingly.

## Pre-requisites
Although this guide attempts to be as beginner-friendly as possible, it does make some assumptions about your background. It assumes:
 * Familiarity with Javascript (you understand what `.bind()` does, and when it might be needed),
 * Familiarity with NodeJS (you understand the module.exports/require pattern, and know of EventEmitters),
 * Some experience with React (you understand the difference between state and props, where state should lie, and how components can set the state of other components),
 * Some experience with __git__ (we'll be switching branches now and again).

## Technologies
We'll be using __react and flux__ in this tutorial. Other than a number of build/dev tools, and __object-assign__ we won't be using anything else.
