A simple tutorial for simple people who want to use flux with react.
This tutorial follows on from [my react tutorial (WIP)](https://github.com/MIJOTHY/REACT_SCHMEACT)

## Pre-requisites
Although this guide attempts to be as beginner-friendly as possible, it does make some assumptions about your background. It assumes:
 * Familiarity with Javascript (you understand what `.bind()` does, and when it might be needed),
 * Understanding of the module.exports / require pattern.
 * Some experience with React (you understand the difference between state and props, where state should lie, and how components can set the state of other components).
